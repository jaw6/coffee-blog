h1. Coffee Blog

This is a simple demo app, written in coffeescript with express/node.js and mongodb. I've been following along with Ciaran Jessup's "excellent tutorial":http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb, but working in coffeescript whenever practical.

h2. Getting started

You'll need to install:

* "mongodb":http://shiftcommathree.com/articles/how-to-install-mongodb-on-os-x (1.4.0)
* "coffee-script":http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#installation (0.6.1)
* "node":http://github.com/ry/node (v0.1.91)
* "kiwi":http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi (0.3.0)

Then install using kiwi:

* express 0.9.0
* haml 0.3.0
* mongodb-native 0.7.1

Then run:

@$ coffee app.coffee@

And visit @localhost:3000@ in your browser.

h2. What works right now

* View all posts
* Show a post, including comments
* Add comments to a post
* Cappuccino-based "admin" area - it's a clone of the blog app from "CappuccinoCasts":http://oldblog.balthazar.info/2009/05/11/8-cappuccino-and-ruby-on-rails-the-weblog-application-part-1/ with very little modification needed to run on top of Express (instead of Rails)
